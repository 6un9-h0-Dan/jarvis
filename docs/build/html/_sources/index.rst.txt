jarvis-tools
========================================

**jarvis-tools: an open-source software package for data-driven atomistic materials design**

Source on Github: https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis

Homepage : https://jarvis.nist.gov/

Sets up high-throughput calculations and analysis for several applications such as:
 * Density functional theory (DFT) [https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/JVASP.html]
 * Classical-force field (FF) [https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~knc6/periodic.html]
 * Machine-learning (ML) [https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/jarvisml/]
